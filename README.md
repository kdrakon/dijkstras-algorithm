# dijkstras-algorithm
Scala and Scala.js implementation of the famous algorithm

## Why?
I wanted to play around with Scala.js... _and to also make something special._

## Demo using Scala.js and D3.js
Check it out here: https://rawcdn.githack.com/kdrakon/dijkstras-algorithm/master/demo/index.html

Or, check out the repository and run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` to run the `demo` folder locally.

## Without Scala.js
Yup, I left a `scala.App` implementation if you want to run it via Scala directly.
